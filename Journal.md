# Issues

## Issue
Telegram gif not showing up on mobile
Using 
> codec= cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MP4V')
out = cv2.VideoWriter(video_name, codec, fps,(640,480))
out.write(frame)


Generate a .mp4 video with is shown as a *gif* in telegram. While the desktop version has no problem viewing it the mobile version 
displays a blank file wich can be seen only by downloading the .mp4.

While generating the file *OpenCv* yelds the following warning
> OpenCV: FFMPEG: tag 0x5634504d/'MP4V' is not supported with codec id 13 and format 'mp4 / MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14)'
OpenCV: FFMPEG: fallback to use tag 0x00000020/' ???'


### Tried Fixes
* Changing the resolution from *640,480* to any other resolution brings telegram to recognize the file as a video (not gif), but it still does not show up in the mobile version
* Changing the file extension to *.mp4v* does not work 
* Changing codec to _cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MPEG')_ does not show gif on desktop too
* Using **isColor=False** does not work

### Solutions
* Changing codec to _cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'avc1')_ and extension to **.mov** sends a file (not a gif) which can be viewd both by the desktop and the mobile version of telegram
* Final solution: Removed the codec calss and used **0x00000021** instead (with **.mp4** extension), found [here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1029451/-python-what-is-the-four-characters-fourcc-code-for-mp4-encoding-on-tx2/)

## Issue
Video difference is laggy 
The video difference is send when a difference in frame is detected, this detection is time costly thus writing a frame to the video object too slowly.
This brings to a laggy gif file.
GRAY SCALING takes 0.01 seconds
SSIM takes about 0.5 seconds for every image, while gray scale takes 0.01 seconds
PSNR takes 0.04 seconds for every image

### Tried Fixes
* Remove *sleep(1/self.fps)* from while loop...not working
* Remove face detection...not working

### Solution
* Taking the frames in the Cam_shotter class resolved the issue

## Issue 
If you are having an error like:
> VIDEOIO ERROR: V4L: index 0 is not correct!

Change the **cam_idx** in Cam_shotter to the correct one for your raspberry pi

## Warning

Encountered when the cam_movement class first start to compute difference between images
>python3.5/site-packages/skimage/measure/simple_metrics.py:142: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in double_scalars
  return 10 * np.log10((data_range ** 2) / err)

## Issue
Using the *haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml* with *CascadeClassifier* yelds a great number of false-positive

### Solution 
Changing to *haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt_tree.xml* resolved the issue

## Issue 
Found error while performing the abs difference *frameDelta = cv2.absdiff(grd_truth, gray)*. In cam_movement class
> OpenCV Error: Sizes of input arguments do not match (The operation is neither 'array op array' (where arrays have the same size and the same number of channels), nor 'array op scalar', nor 'scalar op array') in arithm_op, file /home/pi/InstallationPackages/opencv-3.1.0/modules/core/src/arithm.cpp, line 639

* It seems to be correlated to the number of channels of the images passed.
* When the error occurres the grd_thruth  shape is (480, 640, 3) while the gray is (480,640), the number 3 should not be there since the image is being converted to gray scale with
> gray = cv2.cvtColor(img2, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

### Tried Fixes
* Sorround difference with try catch

### Solution
* Forgot to call  cv2.cvtColor(img2, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) XD

## Issue
If you recieve the following message when starting the program with `python main.py`:
>libv4l2: error setting pixformat: Device or resource busy
VIDEOIO ERROR: libv4l unable to ioctl S_FMT
libv4l2: error setting pixformat: Device or resource busy
libv4l1: error setting pixformat: Device or resource busy
VIDEOIO ERROR: libv4l unable to ioctl VIDIOCSPICT

Use `killall pyhton` (This will stop every pyhton process currently running)

## Issue
Telegram command to get the ground image of the Cam_movement calss seems to stop while writing the image to file. It may be
connected with the continuous use of the ground_image inside the movement class.
It is connected only to the cv.imwrite() function

### Tried Fixes

* Implement a get method
* Return a copy of the object

### Solution
* Send image throught cam_movement class

## Issue
Get the prediction confidence with the *cv2.face.createLBPHFaceRecognizer().predict()* method

### Tried Fixes
* Followed [this](http://answers.opencv.org/question/82294/cant-get-predict-confidence/), but no luck

### Solved
solved by using the collector object
 
 



# Optimization

## Image difference


| Algorithm        | Time taken in seconds| Suggested range |
| -------------    |:-------------:       |  -----:         |
| GRAY SCALING     | 0.01                 |                 |
| SSIM             | 0.5                  | x  <   0.75     |
| PSNR             | 0.03                 | x  <   30       |
| NRMSE            | 0.035                | x  >   0.3      |
| MSE              | 0.025                | x  > 500       |


### MSE
* Change in shadow with value 3919
* It does not detect image far away persons
* Switched to PSNR

### PSNR
* Way more sensible than MSE (in a good way)
* Not so sensitive to shadow changes
* Change detected with score 24, while there was none 
* Is triggered when camera auto adjust brightness
* In bright places it becomes very sensitive -> the use of an *equalizeHist* seems to resolve the problem
* No good in poor light condition

### SSIM
* Using gaussian_weights=True -> time increases to 0.7 seconds

### Passing to  cv2.absdiff

## detectMultiScale

* Currently detectMultiScale is the slowest part of the program, it takes up to 30 seconds fo detect an image. With a time per call of 0.065
* I'm using  scale_factor = 1.4 and min_neight = 3.
* Setting min_size fto (20,20) doesn't change anything
* Setting the min_size to (50,50) speeds up the computation by x3
* Setting mi_size to (100,100) ... small faces won't be recognized
* Setting the min_size to (75,75) too big ... keeping 50

A solution could be paralleling the function for all the frames

## cvtColor
* Taking up to 12% of total time, per call time is   0.013. It is done twice for every frame

A solution could be using the cvtColor inside the cam_shotter, for every first frame.

## face_FaceRecognizer.predict
* Taking up 10% of time with 0.117 seconds per call.
* Try to use paralleling programming
